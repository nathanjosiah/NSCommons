This is a Zend Framework 2 module for boilerplate functionality in all of my projects.

Add it to your project by adding the following to your composer.json:

    "nathanjosiah/zf2-nscommons": "dev-master"


Don't forget to enable the module `NSCommons` in your ZF2 application config.

Contributions are welcome!
